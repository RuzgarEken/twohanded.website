Hi everybody I’m Tarık. I am an indie game developer and I am the sole creator of Elementalist. I've been working on this game for 7 months and I'd like to talk a bit about the current state:
Elementalist is an IO game based on RPG. The main character is a wizard who can use 4 types of elements, namely Earth, Fire, Water and Wind. There are various game modes with different challenges and rewards. You can collect trade materials throughout the game modes and spend them in the shop to get new skins which boost your strength in the battlefield.

Game Mechanics
There are two types of leveling system in the battlefield; the "Character Level" and the "Element Level":
-> "Character Level" increases either by killing your enemeies or collecting random element pieces on the map
- You get higher attack, defense, speed and healing stats
-> "Element Level" increases as you gather the elemenet pieces of your wizard type (i.e. Fire wizard <-> Fire Element)
- You get a specific stat increase based on the element type:
- Earth -> Increased Defense,
- Fire -> Increased Attack,
- Water -> Increased Healing,
- Wind -> Increased Speed
-> Each wizard has 4 unique abilities and a 5th ability which is a dash.
